## Description
This will use an Express.js back end to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes.

## Installation
I would install using npm i and npm install express
You will need to require and use express and fs modules

## Usage
GIVEN a note-taking application<br />
WHEN I open the Note Taker<br />
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page<br />
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page<br />
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column<br />
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text<br />
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page<br />
WHEN I click on the Save icon<br />
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the <br />left-hand column with the other existing notes<br />
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column<br />
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column<br />
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page<br />
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column<br />
